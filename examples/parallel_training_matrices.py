This file demonstrates how to use joblib to parallelise CVMatrix.training_XTX,
CVMatrix.training_XTY, and CVMatrix.training_XTX_XTY to compute training set matrices
:math:`\mathbf{X}^{\mathbf{T}}\mathbf{X}` and
:math:`\mathbf{X}^{\mathbf{T}}\mathbf{Y}` with possible centering and scaling of
`X` and `Y` using training set means and standard deviations.
